Name-Avijit Agarwal, Roll No- 10200116057, Registration No- 161020110010, College Name: KGEC


The activities that I took part in are:
1. Took part in college fests of KGEC, JU main campus, JU salt lake campus,MSIT, Amity University.  - (3+3) points (activity 2)
2. Took part in Internation Collegiate Coding Contest(ICPC) from Kharagpur Regionals and Amritapuri Regionals which qualify as    competitive coding contests at an national level.  -20 points  (activity12)
3. Published several coding solutions online on many sites like codechef, codeforces, etc, during lockdown. Two of which I want    to share is my solution are:

   a. FACTOR TREE problem of April Challenge 2020 in codechef where we need to use MOâ€™s algorithm on trees using path query.
   
   b. Classical problem in Codeforces Round #613 in codeforces which requires 	inclusion-exclusion principle to find maximum         LCM pair in in array of 	numbers.
   
   So this qualifies for coding solution and publishing in the special MAR activitity 12 with (7+7=14 points).
   

All the links to solutions, and fests participation certificates and ICPC id are present in the git repository.

So total points acquired =(3+3+20+7+7)= 40 points
